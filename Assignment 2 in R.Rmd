#The median (value found in the middle of the ordered data set) is 230. Since median is not greatly affected by outliers, it is a better measure of the center of the dataset.

#The mode (most frequently occurring) is 200 which means that at the different schools, the highest occurring number of teachers using the app x in month 1 is 200.

#The Variance and SD are the largest in month 1 with 561861.86 and 749.57 respectively, which means that its values are farthest from the mean
